Python provides several built-in functions to facilitate this conversion, either implicitly (automatic conversion) or explicitly (manual conversion).\n","\n","1. Implicit Type Casting (Automatic)\n","Python automatically converts a data type into another when it encounters mixed types in an expression. This happens mostly in arithmetic operations.\n","Example:\n","\n","x = 10       # Integer\n","y = 2.5      # Float\n","\n","result = x + y  # Python automatically converts 'x' to float for this operation\n","print(result)   # Output: 12.5 (float)\n","In this case, Python converts the integer x to a float automatically because one of the operands (y) is a float.\n","\n","2. Explicit Type Casting (Manual Conversion)\n","Explicit type casting is done using Python’s built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), list(), tuple(), etc. It allows you to manually convert a variable from one type to another.\n","Common Type Casting Functions:\n","int(): Converts a value to an integer.\n","\n","\n","float_value = 7.8\n","int_value = int(float_value)  # Converts float to int\n","print(int_value)  # Output: 7\n","float(): Converts a value to a float.\n","\n","\n","int_value = 5\n","float_value = float(int_value)  # Converts int to float\n","print(float_value)  # Output: 5.0\n","str(): Converts a value to a string.\n","\n","\n","num = 10\n","string_value = str(num)  # Converts int to string\n","print(string_value)  # Output: \"10\"\n","list(): Converts an iterable (like a tuple or a string) to a list.\n","\n","\n","tuple_value = (1, 2, 3)\n","list_value = list(tuple_value)  # Converts tuple to list\n","print(list_value)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]\n","tuple(): Converts an iterable to a tuple.\n","\n","\n","list_value = [1, 2, 3]\n","tuple_value = tuple(list_value)  # Converts list to tuple\n","print(tuple_value)  # Output: (1, 2, 3)\n","Examples of Explicit Type Casting:\n","Example 1: Converting String to Integer\n","\n","string_value = \"123\"\n","int_value = int(string_value)  # Converts string to int\n","print(int_value)  # Output: 123\n","If the string contains non-numeric characters, attempting to cast it to an integer will raise a ValueError.\n","\n","Example 2: Converting List to String\n","\n","my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n","string_value = str(my_list)  # Converts list to string\n","print(string_value)  # Output: \"[1, 2, 3]\"\n","Example 3: Converting Boolean to Integer\n","\n","bool_value = True\n","int_value = int(bool_value)  # Converts boolean to int\n","print(int_value)  # Output: 1\n","In Python, True converts to 1 and False converts to 0.\n","\n","Important Points to Note:\n","Loss of Precision: Converting from float to int results in truncation, meaning the decimal part is discarded, not rounded.\n","\n","\n","result = int(8.7)  # Output: 8\n","Invalid Conversion: Some conversions are not possible.

Illustrate with examples?\n","\n","Answer: Conditional statements in Python allow the execution of different blocks of code based on certain conditions. They help control the flow of a program by making decisions depending on whether an expression evaluates to True or False.\n","\n","Basic Structure of Conditional Statements:\n","if: Executes a block of code if the condition is True.\n","elif: (optional) Specifies another condition to check if the first if condition is False.\n","else: (optional) Executes a block of code if none of the preceding conditions are True.\n","1. if Statement\n","The if statement executes a block of code only if the condition is True.\n","\n","Syntax:\n","\n","if condition:\n","    # Block of code to execute if condition is True\n","Example:\n","\n","\n","age = 18\n","if age >= 18:\n","    print(\"You are eligible to vote.\")  # This will be printed\n","2. if-else Statement\n","The else part allows us to define a block of code that will run if the if condition is False.\n","\n","Syntax:\n","\n","\n","if condition:\n","    # Block of code if condition is True\n","else:\n","    # Block of code if condition is False\n","Example:\n","\n","\n","age = 16\n","if age >= 18:\n","    print(\"You are eligible to vote.\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"You are not eligible to vote.\")  # This will be printed\n","3. if-elif-else Statement\n","The elif (short for \"else if\") allows checking multiple conditions.

It is used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and depends on the satisfaction of a condition.\n","It continues to execute the block of code until the condition becomes False.\n","Syntax:\n","\n","\n","while condition:\n","    # Block of code to execute while the condition is True\n","Example 1: Basic while Loop:\n","\n","\n","count = 1\n","while count <= 5:\n","    print(count)\n","    count += 1\n","Output:\n","\n","\n","1\n","2\n","3\n","4\n","5\n","Example 2: while Loop with Break Condition:\n","\n","\n","number = 0\n","while True:\n","    print(number)\n","    number += 1\n","    if number == 5:\n","        break  # Exits the loop when number equals 5\n","Output:\n","\n","\n","0\n","1\n","2\n","3\n","4\n","Use Cases:\n","\n","Repeatedly performing an action while a condition is true (e.g., reading data from a sensor until a stop signal).\n","Waiting for user input or an event (e.g., a button press).\n","Creating infinite loops (with a break condition to exit).\n","When the number of iterations is unknown, but based on a condition that eventually becomes false.\n","3. break and continue Statements\n","break: Terminates the loop entirely, and control moves to the statement immediately after the loop.\n","continue: Skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.\n","Example 1: Using break:\n","\n","\n","for i in range(10):\n","    if i == 5:\n","        break  # Exits the loop when i equals 5\n","    print(i)\n","Output:\n","\n","\n","0\n","1\n","2\n","3\n","4\n","Example 2: Using continue:\n","\n","\n","for i in range(5):\n","    if i == 3:\n","        continue  # Skips the iteration when i equals 3\n","    print(i)\n","Output:\n","\n","\n","0\n","1\n","2\n","4\n","4. Nested Loops\n","You can have loops inside other loops, which is known as nesting. Nested loops are useful when dealing with multi-dimensional data (e.g., 2D lists or matrices).\n","\n","Example: Nested for Loops:\n","\n","\n","matrix = [\n","    [1, 2, 3],\n","    [4, 5, 6],\n","    [7, 8, 9]\n","]\n","\n","for row in matrix:\n","    for element in row:\n","        print(element, end=\" \")\n","    print()  # Prints a new line after each row\n","Output:\n","\n","\n","1 2 3\n","4 5 6\n","7 8 9\n","5. else with Loops\n","Python allows an else block to be used with loops.
