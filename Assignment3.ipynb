What Are the Five Key Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n","The five key concepts of OOP are:\n","\n","Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some components.\n","Abstraction: Hiding complex details and showing only essential features of an object.\n","Inheritance: Creating new classes based on existing ones, enabling code reuse.\n","Polymorphism: Allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, making it possible to use the same method for different types.\n","Association: Establishing relationships between different classes, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many.\n","2. Write a Python Class for a Car With Attributes for Make, Model, and Year. Include a Method to Display the Car's Information.\n","\n","class Car:\n","    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n","        self.make = make\n","        self.model = model\n","        self.year = year\n","\n","    def display_info(self):\n","        print(f\"Car: {self.make} {self.model}, Year: {self.year}\")\n","\n","# Example usage:\n","my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2022)\n","my_car.display_info()  # Output: Car: Toyota Corolla, Year: 2022\n","3. Explain the Difference Between Instance Methods and Class Methods. Provide an Example of Each.\n","Instance Methods: Work with an instance of a class and access instance-specific data. They require self as the first parameter.\n","\n","Class Methods: Work with the class itself rather than instances, accessing class-level data. They require cls as the first parameter and use the @classmethod decorator.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","\n","class MyClass:\n","    def instance_method(self):\n","        return \"Called instance method\", self\n","\n","    @classmethod\n","    def class_method(cls):\n","        return \"Called class method\", cls\n","\n","obj = MyClass()\n","print(obj.instance_method())  # Output: (\"Called instance method\", <MyClass instance>)\n","print(MyClass.class_method())  # Output: (\"Called class method\", <class '__main__.MyClass'>)\n","4. How Does Python Implement Method Overloading? Give an Example.\n","Python does not support traditional method overloading. Instead, default values or variable-length arguments (*args, **kwargs) can simulate it.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","\n","class MathOperations:\n","    def add(self, a, b=0):\n","        return a + b\n","\n","op = MathOperations()\n","print(op.add(5))       # Output: 5 (single argument)\n","print(op.add(5, 10))   # Output: 15 (two arguments)\n","5. What Are the Three Types of Access Modifiers in Python? How Are They Denoted?\n","The three types of access modifiers in Python are:\n","\n","Public: No underscore (variable). Accessible from anywhere.\n","Protected: Single underscore (_variable). Accessible within the class and its subclasses.\n","Private: Double underscore (__variable). Only accessible within the class where defined.\n","6. Describe the Five Types of Inheritance in Python. Provide a Simple Example of Multiple Inheritance.\n","Single Inheritance: Derived from one base class.\n","Multiple Inheritance: Derived from multiple base classes.\n","Multilevel Inheritance: Derived from a chain of classes.\n","Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple classes derived from one base class.\n","Hybrid Inheritance: Combination of more than one type of inheritance.\n","Example of Multiple Inheritance:\n","\n","\n","class Parent1:\n","    def func1(self):\n","        print(\"Parent1 function\")\n","\n","class Parent2:\n","    def func2(self):\n","        print(\"Parent2 function\")\n","\n","class Child(Parent1, Parent2):\n","    pass\n","\n","c = Child()\n","c.func1()  # Output: Parent1 function\n","c.func2()  # Output: Parent2 function\n","7. What Is the Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python? How Can You Retrieve It Programmatically?\n","MRO is the order in which Python looks for a method in a hierarchy of classes. You can retrieve MRO using the __mro__ attribute or mro() method.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","\n","class A: pass\n","class B(A): pass\n","class C(B): pass\n","\n","print(C.__mro__)       # Outputs the MRO of class C\n","print(C.mro())         # Outputs the MRO of class C\n","8. Create an Abstract Base Class Shape With an Abstract Method area(). Then Create Two Subclasses Circle and Rectangle That Implement the area() Method.\n","\n","from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n","\n","class Shape(ABC):\n","    @abstractmethod\n","    def area(self):\n","        pass\n","\n","class Circle(Shape):\n","    def __init__(self, radius):\n","        self.radius = radius\n","\n","    def area(self):\n","        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2\n","\n","class Rectangle(Shape):\n","    def __init__(self, width, height):\n","        self.width = width\n","        self.height = height\n","\n","    def area(self):\n","        return self.width * self.height\n","\n","circle = Circle(5)\n","rectangle = Rectangle(4, 6)\n","print(circle.area())   # Output: 78.5\n","print(rectangle.area()) # Output: 24\n","9. Demonstrate Polymorphism by Creating a Function That Can Work With Different Shape Objects to Calculate and Print Their Areas.\n","\n","def print_area(shape):\n","    print(\"Area:\", shape.area())\n","\n","print_area(Circle(3))       # Output: Area: 28.26\n","print_area(Rectangle(4, 5)) # Output: Area: 20\n","10. Implement Encapsulation in a BankAccount Class With Private Attributes for balance and account_number. Include Methods for Deposit, Withdrawal, and Balance Inquiry.\n","\n","class BankAccount:\n","    def __init__(self, account_number, initial_balance=0):\n","        self.__account_number = account_number\n","        self.__balance = initial_balance\n","\n","    def deposit(self, amount):\n","        self.__balance += amount\n","\n","    def withdraw(self, amount):\n","        if amount <= self.__balance:\n","            self.__balance -= amount\n","        else:\n","            print(\"Insufficient balance\")\n","\n","    def get_balance(self):\n","        return self.__balance\n","11. Create a Decorator That Measures and Prints the Execution Time of a Function.\n","\n","import time\n","\n","def timer(func):\n","    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n","        start = time.time()\n","        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n","        end = time.time()\n","        print(f\"{func.__name__} took {end - start:.4f} seconds\")\n","        return result\n","    return wrapper\n","12. Write a Class That Overrides the __str__ and __add__ Magic Methods. What Will These Methods Allow You to Do?\n","\n","class Point:\n","    def __init__(self, x, y):\n","        self.x = x\n","        self.y = y\n","\n","    def __str__(self):\n","        return f\"Point({self.x}, {self.y})\"\n","\n","    def __add__(self, other):\n","        return Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)\n","\n","# Example usage:\n","p1 = Point(2, 3)\n","p2 = Point(4, 5)\n","print(p1)           # Output: Point(2, 3)\n","print(p1 + p2)      # Output: Point(6, 8)\n","These methods enable custom string representations and addition of Point objects.\n","\n","13. Explain the Concept of the Diamond Problem in Multiple Inheritance. How Does Python Resolve It?\n","The Diamond Problem occurs when a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a common base class, creating ambiguity. Python resolves it using Method Resolution Order (MRO) with the C3 linearization algorithm, ensuring each class in the inheritance path is called only once.\n","\n","14. Write a Class Method That Keeps Track of the Number of Instances Created From a Class.\n","\n","class MyClass:\n","    count = 0\n","\n","    def __init__(self):\n","        MyClass.count += 1\n","\n","    @classmethod\n","    def instance_count(cls):\n","        return cls.count\n","\n","# Example usage:\n","obj1 = MyClass()\n","obj2 = MyClass()\n","print(MyClass.instance_count())  # Output: 2\n","15.
